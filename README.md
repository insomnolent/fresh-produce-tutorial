# Tutorial for managing the Fresh Produce website!

A crash course on git commands and maybe HTML/CSS for any level programmer 

## Intro
0. Make Github account lol
1. Install git
2. Install a text editor (Sublime, VSCode, Atom, etc.)
3. If you're in mac, open up your regular terminal. If Windows, use powershell because I'm lazy and can't remember the different commands for Windows command prompt

## Some basic commands for the terminal 
- `cd <name of repo>` : goes to that folder
- `ls` : lists all folders in current directory
- `pwd` : tells you your current working directory
- `.` : single period means 'current directory'. So if you do `cd ./<name of file>` it will look for a file in your current directory
- `..` : two periods mean to go up a directory. So `cd ../<name of file>` will look for a file in the directory a level above

## Some basic git commands 
- `git clone <link to project>` : clones that project folder into your current directory
- `git add .` : adds all the files in your current directory
- `git commit -m '<write commit message>'` : makes commit with a custom message. Double check your file changes too
- `git push` : pushes your changes to remote thingie on Github
- `git pull` : pulls latest version and changes from remote project stuff
- There's also this thing called branches but again I am lazy and usually don't make too many drastic changes...
